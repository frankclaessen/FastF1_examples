# FastF1_examples
Working with and trying_out - fun stuff
The repository contains mainly jupyter notebooks for pyhton 3 kernel.

I am not a gr8 programmer - any comments to improve the code are most welcome.

These examples are mainly built on top of existing examples

In the folder results ... you find the track_plots as the result of "Who's te fastest - multi races"
